= Research
I got privileged to collaborate with several folks over the years who shaped my research journey, especially during my Masters at UW-Madison. I enjoy doing research and am grateful for a lot of folks who shaped my journey and made it possible to who I am today. Below is the list of publications and folks I have collaborated with!
