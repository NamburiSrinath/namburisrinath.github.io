I am grateful to all the faculties who taught me as their role is vital in shaping my career.

= Research Interests
I broadly classify my research interests into 2 types
. Interests which I pursue as part of *profession/career* 
	.. Artificial Intelligence
	.. Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Primary focus on Computer Vision)
. Interests which are like a *hobby* 
	.. Biology - Neuroscience, Genetics
	.. Physics (Especially Quantum side)
	.. Economics, Finance
	.. Mathematics

I know I can't be a master in these fields, but I learn by reading various Non Fiction books. Check the [booksandblogs.html Books and Blogs] tab to understand more on this.
