I quite liked this book as it's simple yet covering a lot of interesting aspects about our body. Personally it's oversimplified at places but that shouldn't be a problem for folks planning to pick the book, definitely a good recommendation for anyone curious to understand about self (not the spiritual unfortunately)!

== The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer
==== Author: Siddhartha Mukherjee
==== Read on: Nov 2024
I think this book needs no introduction due to it's fame. If one wants to know about "Cancer" from scientific, political and historical lens with as much as possible in just one read - this is the must I can recommend.

What we know of cancer today is an amalgamation of hundreds of decades of research (sometimes which might have produced counter-productive results), a lot of politics (it is damn hard to understand how much background happens for an area of research to be this fruitful) and often-times occurring serendipitous events and inspirations from entirely other areas (like statistics, AIDS etc;).

I read the book "Gene" by Siddhartha Mukherjee and that inspired me to pick another dense book and I totally enjoyed reading this one.

There are lots of notes/important points/key takeaways that I can take from this book (even though I am from non-medicine background) and maybe in future I plan to develop some easy-to-read blog posts which can serve as some inspiration for me.

== Lying
==== Author: Sam Harris
==== Read on: Aug 2022
Well, whatever information is given by the author, we all know that. But nevertheless, it's important to know the psychology of lying.

The author goes on explaining the different types of lies, different situations where we tend to lie, maintaining secrets, integrity, deception etc;

Eg: Denying to tell the truth is different from telling a different version you won't believe. Suppose you are at place A and when someone asked where you are - You can tell you are not comfortable sharing your location (denying) rather than telling that you are at place B (a different version). Because the moment you lied, you need to remember it, keep track of it and basically are trying to be in 2 different worlds which is not so easy (no one can alter truth and exist in multiple worlds)

In one sentence: Don't lie

==== Author: Mitch Albom
==== Read on: July 2022
Nice, heartfelt and warm book. Came across this book from a good friend of mine and read after a long time :)

Morrie, a professor suffers from ALS which makes him paralyzed. How he view his life, his thoughts on death, relations, love, suffering etc; is something we need to remind ourselves.

Books like these won't teach you anything new. We already know what they say. But if you listen from their perspective (from the perspective of a dying person), it gives a weight. And sometimes, it's important to slow down your life and reflect.

== The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph
==== Author: Ryan Holiday
==== Read on: March 2022
It's around 3.5-4 star. I read "Meditations" by Marcus Aurelius and thought to explore Stoicism. So, I picked this book and it's kind of a good pointer.

Ryan talks about three things that we need to incorporate to make our lives easier

. See clearly - Perceive
. Act correctly - Actions
. Endure and accept the world as it is - Will

Basically, one needs to inculcate the philosophy that life is full of obstacles (physical, emotional, mental etc;) and one has to see these obstacles as an opportunity, and improve selves rather than brooding over.

== Myth = Mithya: Decoding Hindu Mythology
==== Author: Devdutt Pattanaik
==== Read on: Feb 2022
The book tries to interpret meaning behind several fables associated with Hindu mythology. While it's a good read, from the title, I expected a lot more. For most parts, I already know the reasons and thought I might learn a lot more/demystify Hindu mythology.

For starters, it's a good book to understand lots of fables within a couple of hours. But for the rest, this is not the book to pick if you want to know more about Hindu Mythology

Also, the author repeats the same point again and again making it bit boring here and there.

== Maus: A Survivor's Tale: My Father Bleeds History
==== Author: Art Spiegelman
==== Read on: Jan 2022
It's a 2 part book recommended by my friend.

This book describes about the struggles faced by a merchant in World War II. It chose a comic style and has some fun parts as the conversation is between a son and his father where the father is an old person and has his own idiosyncratic actions which irritates son. Few parts of the conversation makes us to think because we all always have these sort of conversations with our grandparents who talk a bit old-fashioned and are insane (atleast from our point of view) because the hardships they had seen are way more different from the hardships we face now.

Atleast, I personally feel that our parents and grandparents faced more difficulties than us. That doesn't mean that we don't have any difficulties. Ours are not existential crisis while most of our parents/grandparents had existential crisis which is definitely more tough to live compared to our day.

Also, the author conveys the series of incidents occurred in WW II including Auschwitz holocaust which might be one of the world's horrible experience. But his writing style is bit relaxing and we might not feel that much trauma when reading it.

Books on a similar line are: "The Diary of a Young Girl", "Man's search for Meaning"

== Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking
==== Author: Malcolm Gladwell
==== Read on: Jan 2022
Very good and easy read. Felt a little bored in the middle but a good pick. First book in the book club by me and my friend.

This basically tells the power of "gut feeling", why it's useful and how it helps in taking decisions. I get this "gut feeling" about something, but usually I don't follow it. I try to take lot of info, analyse, weigh pros and cons and decide on whether to take the action or not. Usually it works fine, but this book discusses about instances where this method might not work well.

The power of judging something by looking/hearing/feeling in the first 2 seconds is pretty cool and it's a learnable skill. Neverthless, the decision taken by this process has it's own flaws and the author discusses those as well in detail.

== They Both Die At The End
==== Author: Adam Silvera
==== Read on: Oct 2021
Omg...It's beautifully written and I am happy that I read this book.

Usually, I won't take notes for fiction, but this has some strong messages that touched my heart. I closely relate myself to Mateo as I myself am a bit introvert, not exploring new places and just sitting at home. But recently, I had decided to "have an equal split in the pie" and realized it's all about balances (before starting this book), and reading this book reinforced my opinion.

There are lots of fictional (or yet-to-be-created-companies) like Death Cast (which tells when you are going to die) and Last friends app (where you can make friends for one last day, sounds like a version of Insta or Snap) and these things made it interesting.

Hahaha..What a funny book it is to read the myths of several cultures across the world. But seriously, this guy might had got some real threats for this book

Jokes apart, this book gives an intro to several mythological stories ranging from Greek, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Egyptian etc; The initial Greek part was way more fun than the entire book. He mocks/ridicules several Gods across several mythological stories. I'm not sure about the truth part, but as the title/and intro says (in a rough sense - 'mythology/myth is something we create for our uses'

Note: This book is not for faint-hearted or for those who take their religion/culture too seriously. He mocks a lot of gods, cusses and criticizes. I had some tough time in reading some parts, but it's ok.

== Almond
==== Author: Sohn Won-pyung
==== Read on: July 2021
Simply wow.

"So, your grandmother was killed in front of you. How did you feel about that?"
"I felt nothing"

These lines simply summarize the novel.

The protagonist Yunjae, suffers from Alexithymia, a brain disorder where his amygdala is underdeveloped. This means he can't express emotions (not only that he even can't feel emotions). Simply, he lacks empathy (a chapter where he doesn't even respond to a butterfly dying in front of him, and the episodes where his family were brutally killed in front of him just baffles the reader). There's another guy named Gon (or Leese) who's childhood was spoiled and turns out to be a mini-goon. How these two meet and What happens as these two 'monsters' interact is the rest of the book.

I just loved reading this as it subtly talks about a neurological disorder (Yunjae's), a psychological issue (Gon's childhood), and pressure from parents towards career (Dora's) and how these characters helped each other (without even knowing that they are actually helping out). Few episodes from Yunjae are just mindblowing (the butterfly episode, preclimax where he stood up for Gon against Street Wire)

The suffering of Yunjae can't be imagined. If his almonds are normal, I believe he would have committed suicide or gone to mental depression

==== Author: Haruki Murakami

Open ending. Multiple interpretations. Murakami style novel (though I read only one small novel of his i.e The Strange Library)

Our protagonist, who's a waiter in a restaurant turns 20 and her plans to celebrate it grandly fails as she gets an unexpected shift. She has to serve dinner to the restaurant owner who stays in room 604 where no one had ever seen him outside of that room for years. What happens in room 604 after she goes?

As usual, Murakami leaves a lot of details for the reader to interpret. We don't even get to know the name of the protagonist?

Open ending. Multiple interpretations. A very crisp book.

Mary Ventura was made board a train by her parents which takes her to Ninth Kingdom. She meets a stranger in train who says that the Ninth Kingdom is only one-way passage i.e no one returns from that place.

Now what's the Ninth Kingdom comprised of? Did Mary still pursued going to Ninth Kingdom or abandoned her journey in the midway? What happens to her? Is the stranger a good lady who genuinely wanted to help Mary or an evil person who misguided her? All these questions were left unanswered which brings in for multiple interpretations.

The author was suffering from clinical depression and killed herself also suggests a different perspective for this short novel. Despite this being rejected as a book, it's beautifully written (apparently she wrote during her studies)

What's the language of alien? Or a species (robots) who might laugh at some of the customs/traditions of humans. Read this short comic to get the sarcastic tone of some of the most human things that we do.

Very funny and written in satirical tone. The words that author came up to describe objects i.e sustenance, revolution day, mouth pushing, ingesting, two-wheel leg pusher, star light dimmer, comfort squares, seriousness cloth, rest-flat place are all very funny when read in comic

If you want some upbeat, do read this and the next book (Stranger planet) by the same author. It barely takes few hours but I'm sure your lips produce U-shape i.e Smile, trying to write in author's tone :)

When you read some books, you get feeling of warmth, cozy, lively and sort of feel-good satisfaction. It's as if the story is played on a screen. Or you are a third person viewing the entire story from a distance. Well, this is one such book written and translated brilliantly.

Nana, a stray cat was bought and sheltered by Satoru. Though they were happy, one day Satoru decides to give away the cat. Despite his humongous affection towards cats, why did Satoru decide to leave it? Did he leave it?

Read the book which explores friendship, funny episodes, emotional bonding as the two travel and meet Satoru's friends. We can view many things from a cat's perspective which at places produced quite a good laugh.

== Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?: Big Questions from Tiny Mortals About Death 
==== Author: Caitlin Doughty
==== Read on: July 2021
Funny, pretty short and highly informative book.

The only thing that's common among all humans (or for that matter, all living beings) is "Death". Cultures, regions, countries, races varies no matter what. Even how different organisms born, different organisms breath varies. But death is the only phenomenon that unites us. And thus it's really important to learn about death.

This book is not sad, and doesn't deal about how people die and all. It deals with questions about what happens to the body after we die (Personally this is my first book in this sub genre and I learned a lot)

This book is written in a Q&A format where the author answers most common questions regarding death such as

1. How do we smell after we die?

2. Will we really see a white light at death bed?

3. What if an astronaut dies in space?

4. Can I wear my dead grandma's bones as jewelry?

And a lot more.

== The Compound Effect: Jumpstart Your Income, Your Life, Your Success

==== Read on: July 2021
Old school. Redundant, routine and almost everything he says is well known to us. He himself says it: "There's no secret formula. Magic bullet. All you need to do is track your habits and start small changes"

These self-help books help only if you aren't pretty clear and are demotivated/looking for strength etc; I realized that spending more time on self-help, personality development books won't really change us much. Read 2-3 books in this genre (at max 5) and start implementing the good points from them instead of clinging over a pile of self-help books for years and repenting later that your life didn't change much.

The number of self-help/personality development books you pick every year should be reducing no matter what.

Overall it's a 4/5 but felt uninterested while reading parts because of the repeated content.

His previous book "Stocks to Riches" is better at understanding the cognitive biases while investing. While this book also lists out, I find the methodologies, analysis and inferring on Sensex data more usual and informative. A good read for a beginner who's looking to learn about value investing, our cognitive biases and how to avoid them.

Every investor want to pick the 'next-great-stock' and want to be like Warren Buffet but very few (maybe 1%) of the investors actually generate huge wealth. It's not because of lack of intelligence. As said in the book. "The lack of temperament is the main issue for an investor to be wealthy". 

"To be wealthy, you don't need an excellent IQ. An average IQ person who can control their emotions during the bear and bull phases and invests for a long duration had never failed in the 100 odd years of stock market"

I am convinced. The best way (not the easiest) to beat the market is "Pick the right stock and stay for long enough". Now, how to know which is the right stock? And how long to stay?

Introductory but very important for all investors. Gives a gentle touch to "Behavioral Finance", how our emotions cloud our judgement, take irrational decisions during volatile markets etc;

Personally, I've suffered from these cognitive biases during this one year of investing in market. Practicing these to control emotions during investment is the toughest and most underrated one.

Anyone who's interested in the long term investing must look into this book not because it offers any techniques but explains our psychology, emotions towards money and how we can leverage for our purpose

If you didn't start investing/savings, then the anecdotes mentioned in this book will definitely have an impact. It's not that we don't know or the author tells new points towards savings, it's about how people over 5000 years ago viewed savings, how their principles are still sound and practical

The most important takeaways are:
1. Always put 10% of your income aside irrespective of your lifestyle and needs.

2. Spend only 70% of your income for yourself and your family

3. Never buy something that you can't afford

4. Invest with the help of wise people. Don't get lured by irrational returns/schemes

== The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness  
==== Author: Morgan Housel
==== Read on: June 2021
When it comes to investment, I also believe that the greatest skill to master is not math or finance but the psychology. The temptation to have ripe fruits when you can wait and get the entire farm. The fear of losing our capital when all you need to do is sit back and relaxed

It's easy to say and very difficult to follow. I myself can't follow at few occasions and when I feel there will be a short fall, I will book profits, and reinvest when it reached a min point. I think I am playing clever but in reality it's not.

Witty, funny and I've learned new concepts in neuroscience. The author explains the neurological point of view for several daily happenings such as

1. Why do we feel motion sickness?

2. Why do we feel very sad during breakups?

3. Why do we get scared at the shadow of a tree?

4. Why do we remember faces but not names?

== Hardcore Self Help: F**k Anxiety
==== Author: Robert Duff
==== Read on: June 2021
Very brief. To the point and offers some good suggestions. Robert Duff clearly says that it has lot of swearing, uses informal language and it actually works for some because it feels as if he is talking to you

He talks about what anxiety is (a brief intro), how it comes (mental and physical factors) and how to deal with it. He also talks about people who doesn't face anxiety in life, how they can support their friends/family if someone feels anxious and they don't know how it feels to be anxious.

Tip: *"Don't give free advice when someone is anxious because most probably, they know about it"*

There are only few books which gives a detailed introduction, history and the future prospects of a field. This book is one of them. Can be considered as a primer for genetics.I can't summarise or try to list important points because there are a plethora and that itself makes a small book. 

If you are interested in science, want to know about yourself and what all this genetic stuff is about do pick the book. It's highly information loaded and will take sometime to read and understand but at the end, you will feel a satisfaction on how the science had evolved from mere ideas to rigorous experimentation.

== If Cats Disappeared from the World
==== Author: Genki Kawamura
==== Read on: May 2021
Quirky. Philosophical. Comical. Thought Provoking. Bit Emotional. A mixture of all these features, this small book describes about a person who is about to die, but magically gets an opportunity to extend his life for one more day. In return he needs to make one item disappear from this world (a trade for his one day)

What did he made disappear in this world? How the world changes because of his decision? Theoretically, he can exchange infinite objects and get infinite days to live. But will he chose to do so? This book makes one to think about the extravagant life that we, present day humans live. The calmness of simplicity is powerful and it's demonstrated (though fictional, most of the points resonate deeply)

"If you want to gain something, you need to lose something", "Life and love are beautiful because they have endings"

== Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative
==== Author: Austin Kleon
==== Read on: May 2021
No bullshit and lengthy, self-repetitive self-help theory. Austin Kleon directly gives 10 points which helped him to be creative. At the start, he writes "When people give advice, it's as if they are talking to their past self". It literally makes sense.

Main points covered are:

1. Copy from your heroes (there's a subtle difference between copying and plagiarizing)

4. There's nothing original. If anyone claims that their piece of work is original, you can backtrace it to some previous version or can find the inspiration for their work.

9. Use paper often. More ideas come when we use pen and paper and when we are in boredom

16. Hobbies, side projects are something which takes nothing and gives joy. So, pursue them throughout your life

25. When you read a book, do check the bibliography. Your next book often lies there

== Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness

The most important points are

1. Libertarian Paternalism: The policy and intervention should be minimal (thus providing freedom of choice to individuals i.e Libertarian) but should provide an intrinsic nudge towards general good (give a gentle push towards a choice if the individual is confused, thus paternalism)

2. Default choice: Most of the time, we just stick with the default (the wallpaper, ringtone etc;) So, policymakers need to make sure that the default is a good one (for public)

3. Talks about education system, climate change, credit cards, savings, investments, insurance, healthcare and how small, subtle changes bring great outcomes in society.

One of the most informative and interesting book I have read. Often we observe natural phenomenon but can't comprehend the science or mechanism behind them. Steven H. Strogatz beautifully explains without using any mathematical equations (and superb metaphors, stories to relate to non-technical readers). Some of the phenomenon covered are:

1. How fireflies light up at the same time?

2. Why we sleep easily at particular time of a day but can't sleep at other time of the day (circadian rhythms)?

3. Decoding brain waves, how to understand the waves

4. Superconductors, how they are created and what laws govern them

5. How networks work, best example is how epidemics (such as Covid) spread in a given cohort?

6. Why (and how) do people in an auditorium clap in harmony?

== Surely You're joking Mr.Feynman
==== Author: Richard P. Feynman
==== Read on: March 2021
Well...most of us know Richard Feynman as one of the world's famous physicist. And a few might have heard about "Feynman technique" when learning a new concept which roughly goes like this "You can vouch that you understood a concept only if you can explain it to a 7 yr old kid and the kid can understand it perfectly"

This book shows the other shades of Feynman. Before reading this, I thought Feynman is a studious fellow who just delves in books and equations. But this gives an entirely new picture of this guy I believe *lived his life to the fullest* He entertains not just himself but everyone who's with him with his sarcasm, idiosyncratic nature and stubbornness. A party guy, who visits bars frequently (and presumably do physics while enjoying), learns new skills (such as playing drums, learning Japanese, Portuguese, painting) to entertain himself himself and get satisfied while he travels across the world (to give lectures).

There are few incidents in this book which makes us laugh at how childish he behaves at others (though his stubbornness is altogether the next level) such as

1. For a particular trip, the manager asks to produce tickets to reimburse the amount. Feynman says he won't give tickets because you have to trust on what he say instead of some paper. Finally, he doesn't get his reimbursement and continues not to produce tickets

2. For a particular contract, he says he'll only sign at 13 places. But the entire contract has 14 signatures with the last one being his paycheque. Still he doesn't sign on that

And there are lot of other incidents which I am sure will make us laugh. Some of them made me think "Is he really the Nobel laureate?"

Usually, I read a book slowly, to grasp details and feel it. But this one, I felt anxious to reach till the end and probably that made this book my fastest fiction read. The suspense carried till the end was just amazing. The way the author unravels the facts at the last 10-20 pages literally makes one jump out of the seat.

Highly relatable to present scenario. Can't specifically classify as fiction. It's a mixture of poetry, fiction, (contemporary as well) and towards the end a bit suspense (which was actually unexpected)

"What if you were house arrested for a couple of months?" - We had experienced it via lockdown in 2020. And the good thing is, we have internet, TV etc to pass time.

"But what if someone is house arrested in a hotel for the rest of their life? And the moment that person steps out of the hotel, he/she will be killed". This was the premise of the novel.

== Astrophysics for people in a hurry 
==== Author: Neil deGrasse Tyson
==== Read on: Jan 2021
First time I've known about Neil deGrasse Tyson in few TV series as a guest appearence (Big Bang Theory, Brooklyn 99). That's how I searched and got across this book. It's a very small yet powerful book which walks us through some beauties in the universe. As the author mentions in his book (abridged)

"This book provides you just the right amount of information so your lunch time conversations might be serious sometimes but not so much to get confused"

Well, Neil deGrasse Tyson had done a great job. He explains topics such as

. DarkMatter: How it was discovered
. DarkEnergy: What's the reason we had to discover this
. Search for Exoplanets: How close we are to our distant neighbours and how's the quest going
. Periodic table in the universe: Describing elements from the perspective of an astrophysicist
. Big Bang theory
. Anthropocentric nature of us and how we need to look at the bigger picture. (The eg where he says, we are drinking the urine of Archimedes or breathing the air of Napolean Bonaparte should make us a little less anthropocentric)

with precise information.

Though it's not very easy for general audience to understand all the technicalites in the book (especially the initial few chapters), I believe this is the best that a non-tech/non-science can start off with to understand about ourselves (when I mean ourselves, I mean the entire universe).

== Sapiens: A brief history of humankind
==== Author: Yuval Noah Harari
==== Read on: Jan 2021
As an already acclaimed book, this carries pretty intense, well detailed stuff about us. It's as if one has looked on Earth for past 13 billion years and summarized it. Books like this are hard to summarize/review in detail because every couple of pages offers something. But a few of them are:

. How Agricultural Revolution is not good for humans Yes!! I was shocked after reading the author's perspective, with evidences because I believed Agricultural Revolution is something we created to make us more relaxed, comforting and happy. But it turns out ever since then, we began working too hard, anxious, troubled and more suffering than ever

. Inter-related reality, imagined myths i.e how we assign value to money, religion, things, stocks, properties (tangible or intangible, still)

. Philosophical thoughts into the meaning of life, death etc. One eg to quote is about Buddhism which says suffering or happiness is present inside us because we crave for one to exist and other to vanish. Instead, it's better to pass each and every feeling without worrying about whether it will persist to continue or not

. How we are creating havoc to ecosystem for our own greed. Population of many animals depleted and became extinct within a couple of centuries once humans started colonizing unknown places. And our own greed is causing many animals including chickens, cows, pigs etc; to suffer hell on Earth

== Reminiscences of a Stock Operator 
==== Author: Edwin Lefevre
==== Read on: Dec 2020
It's a very niche book. This is about the journey of Larry Livingstone, a common man who started as a board boy and turned to a millionaire in the US stock market in the early 1900s. He makes and loses millions of dollars couple of times and this book is like a journal describing his journey, his mistakes and lessons learnt.

Though the market changed a lot in the last century, the basic principles described via his anecdotes are still sound. Few noteworthy mentions are:

. *Tips* - How we get influenced by outside information (it might be legit, still the sole decision should be made by the person)

. *Manipulations* - How people with large sums of money can manipulate market
At few places, we can relate it to Harshad Mehta's scam of 1992

. *Ignorance, Hope, Greed, Fear* - We hold a stock even if it delivers losses for a long time hoping one day tables turn and we will get profits. And we sell a stock as soon as we get a small profit fearing that it might fall down (so internally feeling to have atleast this profit)

*Note:* This point is not valid for value investors or for that matter investors who look at the long run. Overall, this book is more suitable for traders.

== Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions 
==== Author: Dan Ariely
==== Read on: Nov 2020
. Why did you end up taking a year membership to that gym where a 6 months might be enough?
. Might feel okay when we steal an item from a shop (or grab extra pens from office) but feel guilty when we steal cash
. Commit ourselves that we will reduce 10kgs or read 100 books by the end of the year but couldn't even reach half the goal
. How a 5 dollar medicine couldn't cure but a 50 dollar one's does miraculously?
. Believes that while buying we should get for the lowest possible price and while selling we should get for the highest possible price

We make irrational decisions and we all know that. But only some of us know that those decisions are predictable, repeatable and can be changed (not easily though). This book by Dan Ariely explores on some of those irrational decisions we make and how we can do better by simply listening to ourselves before deciding. Do read this book to understand how human behavior works and how we can be the real owners of our decisions where author demonstrates with a series of experiments

==== Author: Oliver Sacks
==== Read on: Oct 2020
This book deals with the extreme bizarre neurological cases observed by Dr. Oliver Sacks in the 19th century. He claims that every case needs to be treated separately because some patients would like to have a disease (yes, it may sound strange but read it) rather than getting cured while some patients feel bad after it's cured etc; It's a bit technical and somewhat difficult to follow for a normal reader so choose accordingly after reading the review.

*Have you ever felt that a disease is something that just destroys the person i.e the affected will be unhappy for the rest of their life?*

If you think it's a YES, definitely read this book to know why you might not be correct. If you say it's a NO (means you already know few people with some peculiar diseases who lead happy life), then maybe this adds new perspective and lots of extra information. (I am not supporting that it's good to have a disease but their cases teach a lot about life)

== When Breathe Becomes Air
==== Author: Paul Kalanithi
==== Read on: July 2020
 Suppose you are a highly successful, respected person in your field and there's no one to stop you from your dreams. But one day, you came to know that you are going to die.

. What's your reaction?
. What about Family, friends, successful career etc. For whom will you give more importance?
. Will you choose a PAINFUL EXPERIENCE BUT EXTENDING LIFE FOR A SHORT DURATION or a SILENT BUT INSTANT DEATH? 
. Now suppose, your partner or very close acquaintance is in death bed and the doctor asked you to choose whether to proceed with PAINFUL EXPERIENCE BUT EXTENDING LIFE or a SILENT DEATH. What will you choose now?

Obviously there is no one-answer-for-all. Thinking about death is very uncomfortable but trust me, books like this prove that it's necessary.

== She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Story of Heredity, Its Past, Present and Future 
==== Author: Carl Zimmer
==== Read on: July 2020
I personally thought that *HEREDITY == GENES* and often interchange in conversations. This book is mind blowing and changed my perspective a lot.
. Most of us always think that /"This is out of my scope, I cant do anything, because it's GENES"/ when it comes to obesity, height, color, diseases etc; Is it true? Is heredity all about genes passing from parents from offspring (By now, you might guess it as NOT, but what else is there).
. /Can you believe that we can eradicate malaria from earth by injecting some gene to one mosquito and give some time for it to breed with others so they effectively become potent (roughly speaking)?/

*P.S: * For those who feel animals are dumb because they can't speak or read or do math, try to swim for 100s of kms without any technology. Try to fly. Or atleast try to walk 100s of kms (majority can't do)

The main point is, /"EVOLUTION HELPS CERTAIN ORGANISMS TO LEARN CERTAIN THINGS"/. Metaphorically, /What's the use of sand in a desert?/

It's such an emotional story of Marie Laure (a blind girl) and Werner (an orphan) and the book is an absolute page-turner. The author used psychological tactics and made each chapter constrained to 1-2 pages so that reader is intact and he changed the narration in multiple timelines (Something similar to Nolan's technique in movies). The author made a gripping and heart touching fiction connecting radio, some magical stone, an orphan and a blind girl.

==== Read on: May 2020
Whenever you look at the stories of successful companies, it is exciting to see how the founders are highly passionate towards their dreams. While most of us are aware of the anecdotes like /“college-dropout-making-computers” (Microsoft)/ or /“connectivity-from-dorms” (Facebook)/, we might not have heard the stories of other companies. Phil Knight, made an attempt to share his journey in creating Nike with his memoir, “Shoe dog”. It’s heart touching, a fascinating journey and has philosophical aspects. His life (or maybe his narration) is somewhat cinematic where the protagonist explores the world, takes risks, has ups and downs and finally builds this huge empire that we see today.

May 2020: Currently, we are in lockdown and are in home for past 50 days or so. If anyone of you feels that *"What's this torture to me?"*, then you should definitely read this book. We have social media, TV, internet and a lot of other distractions yet, we feel so lonely during lockdown and feels it as a "prison" and want to go out.

Favourite lines from book:
. Paper has more patience than people
. You only really get to know a person after a fight. Only then you can judge their true character
. The apple never falls far from the tree
. Riches, prestige, everything can be lost. But the happiness in your heart can only be dimmed: it will always be there, as long as you live, to make you happy again
. Deep down, the young are lonelier than the old

I came to Bangalore (India) in Aug 2019 and within a few days, the first problem I faced was /“To search a room”/. The company gave a week to search and settle down. Luckily, I found a good place to stay near the office within 2 days. But a small question came to my mind, *“For how long should I need to search to secure a room, given the competition for PGs or flats?”* — Is there any safe way to search and secure a good room?
Within a couple of months, I found the answer (or a mathematical explanation) for this question. (though it was accidentally by reading this book!)

Have you ever felt like *“What’s the use of this?”* or *“Where can I apply this practically?”* (when studying a particular theory). This book offers excellent applications of how computer science algorithms (or mathematics) can be applied to our daily world problems and improve our decision-making skills.

== Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything
==== Authors: Steven D Levitt
==== Read on: Feb 2019
If I say everything is related with one another, what will come to your head in the first place?

"Chaos theory", "Butterfly effect", some jargons in science. But this book tries to clearly explain the relationship between two things that a common person might think as unrelatable. And the real beauty of the book is, it just won't say these are related like this, but establishes the facts and figures.
