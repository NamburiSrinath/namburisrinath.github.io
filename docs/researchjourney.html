<h1>Research Journey (Unfiltered)</h1>
<p>If you landed to this page, it means you are interested to know more about &ldquo;How to build a research profile?&rdquo; or to know about my journey. Please refer to <a href="publications.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>publications page</a> for actual resources as this page is more about the story behind the publications.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I am not the right guy to get inspiration from. I have this inferior complex most of the times and while I don't compare with others, I always look high of my peer accomplishments and try to get inspiration and push myself harder (sometimes hurting!) to improve myself and my skills. </p>
<p>That being said, <b>there's a lot of serendipity and perseverance</b> that goes on in building a research profile as it's not everyone's cup of tea. The <b>ability to handle rejections</b> is a true skill that a researcher will develop over the course of one's journey. Occasionally, I take break from all kinds of work. And my friends (who are fellow researchers) always suggest to <b>focus on building skills</b> and <b>doing good work</b> rather than targetting for a publication as a good work eventually results in a good paper (or a good patent, good research blog post). While I agree to his advice, given this fast-paced field, the sheer amount of pressure and expectations being built around the community makes it even more difficult to stay at top of the field.</p>
<p>I am sorry but I don't have any particular advice if you are looking for one. Neither am I qualified enough to provide any such advice. I made this page so at a bare minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It should serve as a gentle reminder of the journey that I went through to become who I am now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To show how perseverance and serendipity is very important in building an overall profile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To be grateful for all the things that happened along my journey and serve as a motivation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To keep track of my research journey (and it might help someone out there!!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> As such, I wanted to keep the unfiltered, raw truth version which won't be rosy. Obviously, this will be heavily filtered in professional resume (which I believe is the case of almost everyone).</p>

<b>Story</b> <br />
I collaborated with a PhD student at the Robotics lab and worked part-time for &nbsp;2years on this project developing circuits. That finally resulted in a journal publication. <br />
After 5years, when I reflect, I honestly feel this journal is not reputable, not my best work and the quality of paper can be improved quite a lot. And I might have actually been better if I got involved in other projects as well (I had to forgo some interesting robotics competition because of overlapping</p>
