Very rare, I write something other than summaries/opinion on books and here I catalog those.

*P.S: * I know I am terrible at fiction and poems (own write ups). But I feel /Trying is more important than sitting idle./

== A Dystopian Tomorrow
==== Whats it about: Fiction, about plastic comsumption

We all know that plastic is not good for environment but still tend to use it. I tried a small fiction about what happens in future and suggestions on how to avoid plastic. 

*Note: * I believe awareness and reduction is important than a strict enforcement. Sometimes I do forget and carry plastic but eventually I developed -ve feedback so that the urge to use plastic reduced drastically.
