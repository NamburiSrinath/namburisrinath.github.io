<h4>Author: Adam Silvera</h4>
<h4>Read on: Oct 2021</h4>
<p>Omg&hellip;It's beautifully written and I am happy that I read this book.</p>
<p>Usually, I won't take notes for fiction, but this has some strong messages that touched my heart. I closely relate myself to Mateo as I myself am a bit introvert, not exploring new places and just sitting at home. But recently, I had decided to &ldquo;have an equal split in the pie&rdquo; and realized it's all about balances (before starting this book), and reading this book reinforced my opinion.</p>
<p>There are lots of fictional (or yet-to-be-created-companies) like Death Cast (which tells when you are going to die) and Last friends app (where you can make friends for one last day, sounds like a version of Insta or Snap) and these things made it interesting.</p>

<h4>Author: Cory O'Brien</h4>
<h4>Read on: Sept 2021</h4>
<p>Hahaha..What a funny book it is to read the myths of several cultures across the world. But seriously, this guy might had got some real threats for this book</p>
<p>Jokes apart, this book gives an intro to several mythological stories ranging from Greek, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Egyptian etc; The initial Greek part was way more fun than the entire book. He mocks<i>ridicules several Gods across several mythological stories. I'm not sure about the truth part, but as the title</i>and intro says (in a rough sense - 'mythology/myth is something we create for our uses&rsquo;</p>
<p>Note: This book is not for faint-hearted or for those who take their religion/culture too seriously. He mocks a lot of gods, cusses and criticizes. I had some tough time in reading some parts, but it's ok.</p>

<h4>Author: Sohn Won-pyung</h4>
<h4>Read on: July 2021</h4>
<p>Simply wow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, your grandmother was killed in front of you. How did you feel about that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I felt nothing&rdquo;</p>
<p>These lines simply summarize the novel.</p>
<p>The protagonist Yunjae, suffers from Alexithymia, a brain disorder where his amygdala is underdeveloped. This means he can't express emotions (not only that he even can't feel emotions). Simply, he lacks empathy (a chapter where he doesn't even respond to a butterfly dying in front of him, and the episodes where his family were brutally killed in front of him just baffles the reader). There's another guy named Gon (or Leese) who's childhood was spoiled and turns out to be a mini-goon. How these two meet and What happens as these two 'monsters&rsquo; interact is the rest of the book.</p>
<p>I just loved reading this as it subtly talks about a neurological disorder (Yunjae's), a psychological issue (Gon's childhood), and pressure from parents towards career (Dora's) and how these characters helped each other (without even knowing that they are actually helping out). Few episodes from Yunjae are just mindblowing (the butterfly episode, preclimax where he stood up for Gon against Street Wire)</p>
<p>The suffering of Yunjae can't be imagined. If his almonds are normal, I believe he would have committed suicide or gone to mental depression</p>

<h4>Author: Haruki Murakami</h4>
<h4>Read on: July 2021</h4>
<p>Open ending. Multiple interpretations. Murakami style novel (though I read only one small novel of his i.e The Strange Library)</p>
<p>Our protagonist, who's a waiter in a restaurant turns 20 and her plans to celebrate it grandly fails as she gets an unexpected shift. She has to serve dinner to the restaurant owner who stays in room 604 where no one had ever seen him outside of that room for years. What happens in room 604 after she goes?</p>
<p>As usual, Murakami leaves a lot of details for the reader to interpret. We don't even get to know the name of the protagonist?</p>

<h4>Author: Sylvia Plath</h4>
<h4>Read on: July 2021</h4>
<p>Open ending. Multiple interpretations. A very crisp book.</p>
<p>Mary Ventura was made board a train by her parents which takes her to Ninth Kingdom. She meets a stranger in train who says that the Ninth Kingdom is only one-way passage i.e no one returns from that place.</p>
<p>Now what's the Ninth Kingdom comprised of? Did Mary still pursued going to Ninth Kingdom or abandoned her journey in the midway? What happens to her? Is the stranger a good lady who genuinely wanted to help Mary or an evil person who misguided her? All these questions were left unanswered which brings in for multiple interpretations.</p>
<p>The author was suffering from clinical depression and killed herself also suggests a different perspective for this short novel. Despite this being rejected as a book, it's beautifully written (apparently she wrote during her studies)</p>

<p>P.S: It's almost similar review for both the books.</p>
<p>What's the language of alien? Or a species (robots) who might laugh at some of the customs/traditions of humans. Read this short comic to get the sarcastic tone of some of the most human things that we do.</p>
<p>Very funny and written in satirical tone. The words that author came up to describe objects i.e sustenance, revolution day, mouth pushing, ingesting, two-wheel leg pusher, star light dimmer, comfort squares, seriousness cloth, rest-flat place are all very funny when read in comic</p>
<p>If you want some upbeat, do read this and the next book (Stranger planet) by the same author. It barely takes few hours but I'm sure your lips produce U-shape i.e Smile, trying to write in author's tone :) </p>

<h4>Read on: July 2021</h4>
<p>When you read some books, you get feeling of warmth, cozy, lively and sort of feel-good satisfaction. It's as if the story is played on a screen. Or you are a third person viewing the entire story from a distance. Well, this is one such book written and translated brilliantly.</p>
<p>Nana, a stray cat was bought and sheltered by Satoru. Though they were happy, one day Satoru decides to give away the cat. Despite his humongous affection towards cats, why did Satoru decide to leave it? Did he leave it?</p>
<p>Read the book which explores friendship, funny episodes, emotional bonding as the two travel and meet Satoru's friends. We can view many things from a cat's perspective which at places produced quite a good laugh.</p>

<h4>Author: Caitlin Doughty</h4>
<h4>Read on: July 2021</h4>
<p>Funny, pretty short and highly informative book.</p>
<p>The only thing that's common among all humans (or for that matter, all living beings) is &ldquo;Death&rdquo;. Cultures, regions, countries, races varies no matter what. Even how different organisms born, different organisms breath varies. But death is the only phenomenon that unites us. And thus it's really important to learn about death.</p>
<p>This book is not sad, and doesn't deal about how people die and all. It deals with questions about what happens to the body after we die (Personally this is my first book in this sub genre and I learned a lot)</p>
<p>This book is written in a Q&amp;A format where the author answers most common questions regarding death such as</p>
<p>1. How do we smell after we die?</p>
<p>2. Will we really see a white light at death bed?</p>
<p>3. What if an astronaut dies in space?</p>
<p>4. Can I wear my dead grandma's bones as jewelry?</p>
<p>And a lot more. </p>

<h4>Author: Darren Hardy</h4>
<h4>Read on: July 2021</h4>
<p>Old school. Redundant, routine and almost everything he says is well known to us. He himself says it: &ldquo;There's no secret formula. Magic bullet. All you need to do is track your habits and start small changes&rdquo;</p>
<p>These self-help books help only if you aren't pretty clear and are demotivated/looking for strength etc; I realized that spending more time on self-help, personality development books won't really change us much. Read 2-3 books in this genre (at max 5) and start implementing the good points from them instead of clinging over a pile of self-help books for years and repenting later that your life didn't change much.</p>
<p>The number of self-help/personality development books you pick every year should be reducing no matter what. </p>

<h4>Author: Parag Parikh</h4>
<h4>Read on: June 2021</h4>
<p>Overall it's a 4/5 but felt uninterested while reading parts because of the repeated content.</p>
<p>His previous book &ldquo;Stocks to Riches&rdquo; is better at understanding the cognitive biases while investing. While this book also lists out, I find the methodologies, analysis and inferring on Sensex data more usual and informative. A good read for a beginner who's looking to learn about value investing, our cognitive biases and how to avoid them. And has some interesting analysis on Sensex data (some ideas might be counterintuitive till we see the tabulated results) </p>

<p>There are lots of anecdotes at the start about Patel, Manilal's, Mittal's etc; to describe the Dhandho framework. That part can be just glanced. Otherwise it's a 4/5.</p>

<h4>Author: Christopher H Browne</h4>
<h4>Read on: June 2021</h4>
<p>Every investor want to pick the 'next-great-stock&rsquo; and want to be like Warren Buffet but very few (maybe 1%) of the investors actually generate huge wealth. It's not because of lack of intelligence. As said in the book. &ldquo;The lack of temperament is the main issue for an investor to be wealthy&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;To be wealthy, you don't need an excellent IQ. An average IQ person who can control their emotions during the bear and bull phases and invests for a long duration had never failed in the 100 odd years of stock market&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am convinced. The best way (not the easiest) to beat the market is &ldquo;Pick the right stock and stay for long enough&rdquo;. Now, how to know which is the right stock? And how long to stay?</p>

<p>Personally, I've suffered from these cognitive biases during this one year of investing in market. Practicing these to control emotions during investment is the toughest and most underrated one.</p>

<p>If you didn't start investing/savings, then the anecdotes mentioned in this book will definitely have an impact. It's not that we don't know or the author tells new points towards savings, it's about how people over 5000 years ago viewed savings, how their principles are still sound and practical</p>
<p>The most important takeaways are:
1. Always put 10% of your income aside irrespective of your lifestyle and needs.</p>
<p>2. Spend only 70% of your income for yourself and your family</p>
<p>3. Never buy something that you can't afford</p>
<p>4. Invest with the help of wise people. Don't get lured by irrational returns/schemes</p>

<h4>Author: Morgan Housel</h4>
<h4>Read on: June 2021</h4>
<p>When it comes to investment, I also believe that the greatest skill to master is not math or finance but the psychology. The temptation to have ripe fruits when you can wait and get the entire farm. The fear of losing our capital when all you need to do is sit back and relaxed</p>
<p>It's easy to say and very difficult to follow. I myself can't follow at few occasions and when I feel there will be a short fall, I will book profits, and reinvest when it reached a min point. I think I am playing clever but in reality it's not.</p>

<p>1. Why do we feel motion sickness?</p>
<p>2. Why do we feel very sad during breakups?</p>
<p>3. Why do we get scared at the shadow of a tree?</p>

<h4>Author: Robert Duff</h4>
<h4>Read on: June 2021</h4>
<p>Very brief. To the point and offers some good suggestions. Robert Duff clearly says that it has lot of swearing, uses informal language and it actually works for some because it feels as if he is talking to you</p>
<p>He talks about what anxiety is (a brief intro), how it comes (mental and physical factors) and how to deal with it. He also talks about people who doesn't face anxiety in life, how they can support their friends/family if someone feels anxious and they don't know how it feels to be anxious.</p>
<p>Tip: <b>&ldquo;Don't give free advice when someone is anxious because most probably, they know about it&rdquo;</b></p>

<h4>Read on: May 2021</h4>
<p>There are only few books which gives a detailed introduction, history and the future prospects of a field. This book is one of them. Can be considered as a primer for genetics.I can't summarise or try to list important points because there are a plethora and that itself makes a small book. </p>
<p>If you are interested in science, want to know about yourself and what all this genetic stuff is about do pick the book. It's highly information loaded and will take sometime to read and understand but at the end, you will feel a satisfaction on how the science had evolved from mere ideas to rigorous experimentation. </p>

<h4>Author: Genki Kawamura</h4>
<h4>Read on: May 2021</h4>
<p>Quirky. Philosophical. Comical. Thought Provoking. Bit Emotional. A mixture of all these features, this small book describes about a person who is about to die, but magically gets an opportunity to extend his life for one more day. In return he needs to make one item disappear from this world (a trade for his one day)</p>
<p>What did he made disappear in this world? How the world changes because of his decision? Theoretically, he can exchange infinite objects and get infinite days to live. But will he chose to do so? This book makes one to think about the extravagant life that we, present day humans live. The calmness of simplicity is powerful and it's demonstrated (though fictional, most of the points resonate deeply)</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to gain something, you need to lose something&rdquo;, &ldquo;Life and love are beautiful because they have endings&rdquo; </p>

<h4>Author: Austin Kleon</h4>
<h4>Read on: May 2021</h4>
<p>No bullshit and lengthy, self-repetitive self-help theory. Austin Kleon directly gives 10 points which helped him to be creative. At the start, he writes &ldquo;When people give advice, it's as if they are talking to their past self&rdquo;. It literally makes sense.</p>
<p>Main points covered are:</p>
<p>1. Copy from your heroes (there's a subtle difference between copying and plagiarizing)</p>
<p>4. There's nothing original. If anyone claims that their piece of work is original, you can backtrace it to some previous version or can find the inspiration for their work.</p>
<p>9. Use paper often. More ideas come when we use pen and paper and when we are in boredom</p>
<p>16. Hobbies, side projects are something which takes nothing and gives joy. So, pursue them throughout your life</p>
<p>25. When you read a book, do check the bibliography. Your next book often lies there </p>

<h4>Author: Richard H. Thaler, Cass R. Sunstein</h4>
<h4>Read on: May 2021</h4>
<p>The most important points are</p>
<p>1. Libertarian Paternalism: The policy and intervention should be minimal (thus providing freedom of choice to individuals i.e Libertarian) but should provide an intrinsic nudge towards general good (give a gentle push towards a choice if the individual is confused, thus paternalism)</p>
<p>2. Default choice: Most of the time, we just stick with the default (the wallpaper, ringtone etc;) So, policymakers need to make sure that the default is a good one (for public)</p>
<p>3. Talks about education system, climate change, credit cards, savings, investments, insurance, healthcare and how small, subtle changes bring great outcomes in society.</p>

<p>One of the most informative and interesting book I have read. Often we observe natural phenomenon but can't comprehend the science or mechanism behind them. Steven H. Strogatz beautifully explains without using any mathematical equations (and superb metaphors, stories to relate to non-technical readers). Some of the phenomenon covered are:</p>
<p>1. How fireflies light up at the same time?</p>
<p>2. Why we sleep easily at particular time of a day but can't sleep at other time of the day (circadian rhythms)?</p>
<p>3. Decoding brain waves, how to understand the waves</p>
<p>4. Superconductors, how they are created and what laws govern them</p>
<p>5. How networks work, best example is how epidemics (such as Covid) spread in a given cohort?</p>
<p>6. Why (and how) do people in an auditorium clap in harmony?</p>

<h4>Author: Richard P. Feynman</h4>
<h4>Read on: March 2021</h4>
<p>Well&hellip;most of us know Richard Feynman as one of the world's famous physicist. And a few might have heard about &ldquo;Feynman technique&rdquo; when learning a new concept which roughly goes like this &ldquo;You can vouch that you understood a concept only if you can explain it to a 7 yr old kid and the kid can understand it perfectly&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book shows the other shades of Feynman. Before reading this, I thought Feynman is a studious fellow who just delves in books and equations. But this gives an entirely new picture of this guy I believe <b>lived his life to the fullest</b> He entertains not just himself but everyone who's with him with his sarcasm, idiosyncratic nature and stubbornness. A party guy, who visits bars frequently (and presumably do physics while enjoying), learns new skills (such as playing drums, learning Japanese, Portuguese, painting) to entertain himself himself and get satisfied while he travels across the world (to give lectures).</p>
<p>There are few incidents in this book which makes us laugh at how childish he behaves at others (though his stubbornness is altogether the next level) such as</p>
<p>1. For a particular trip, the manager asks to produce tickets to reimburse the amount. Feynman says he won't give tickets because you have to trust on what he say instead of some paper. Finally, he doesn't get his reimbursement and continues not to produce tickets</p>
<p>2. For a particular contract, he says he'll only sign at 13 places. But the entire contract has 14 signatures with the last one being his paycheque. Still he doesn't sign on that</p>
<p>And there are lot of other incidents which I am sure will make us laugh. Some of them made me think &ldquo;Is he really the Nobel laureate?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Author: Neil deGrasse Tyson</h4>
<h4>Read on: Jan 2021</h4>
<p>First time I've known about Neil deGrasse Tyson in few TV series as a guest appearence (Big Bang Theory, Brooklyn 99). That's how I searched and got across this book. It's a very small yet powerful book which walks us through some beauties in the universe. As the author mentions in his book (abridged)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This book provides you just the right amount of information so your lunch time conversations might be serious sometimes but not so much to get confused&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, Neil deGrasse Tyson had done a great job. He explains topics such as</p>
<ol>
<li><p>DarkMatter: How it was discovered</p>
</li>
<li><p>DarkEnergy: What's the reason we had to discover this</p>
</li>
<li><p>Search for Exoplanets: How close we are to our distant neighbours and how's the quest going</p>
</li>
<li><p>Periodic table in the universe: Describing elements from the perspective of an astrophysicist</p>
</li>
<li><p>Big Bang theory</p>
</li>
<li><p>Anthropocentric nature of us and how we need to look at the bigger picture. (The eg where he says, we are drinking the urine of Archimedes or breathing the air of Napolean Bonaparte should make us a little less anthropocentric)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>with precise information.</p>
<p>Though it's not very easy for general audience to understand all the technicalites in the book (especially the initial few chapters), I believe this is the best that a non-tech/non-science can start off with to understand about ourselves (when I mean ourselves, I mean the entire universe). </p>

<h4>Author: Yuval Noah Harari</h4>
<h4>Read on: Jan 2021</h4>
<p>As an already acclaimed book, this carries pretty intense, well detailed stuff about us. It's as if one has looked on Earth for past 13 billion years and summarized it. Books like this are hard to summarize/review in detail because every couple of pages offers something. But a few of them are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How Agricultural Revolution is not good for humans Yes!! I was shocked after reading the author's perspective, with evidences because I believed Agricultural Revolution is something we created to make us more relaxed, comforting and happy. But it turns out ever since then, we began working too hard, anxious, troubled and more suffering than ever</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Inter-related reality, imagined myths i.e how we assign value to money, religion, things, stocks, properties (tangible or intangible, still)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>Philosophical thoughts into the meaning of life, death etc. One eg to quote is about Buddhism which says suffering or happiness is present inside us because we crave for one to exist and other to vanish. Instead, it's better to pass each and every feeling without worrying about whether it will persist to continue or not</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p>How we are creating havoc to ecosystem for our own greed. Population of many animals depleted and became extinct within a couple of centuries once humans started colonizing unknown places. And our own greed is causing many animals including chickens, cows, pigs etc; to suffer hell on Earth</p>

<h4>Author: Edwin Lefevre</h4>
<h4>Read on: Dec 2020</h4>
<p>It's a very niche book. This is about the journey of Larry Livingstone, a common man who started as a board boy and turned to a millionaire in the US stock market in the early 1900s. He makes and loses millions of dollars couple of times and this book is like a journal describing his journey, his mistakes and lessons learnt.</p>
<p>Though the market changed a lot in the last century, the basic principles described via his anecdotes are still sound. Few noteworthy mentions are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Tips</b> - How we get influenced by outside information (it might be legit, still the sole decision should be made by the person)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Manipulations</b> - How people with large sums of money can manipulate market
At few places, we can relate it to Harshad Mehta's scam of 1992</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><p><b>Ignorance, Hope, Greed, Fear</b> - We hold a stock even if it delivers losses for a long time hoping one day tables turn and we will get profits. And we sell a stock as soon as we get a small profit fearing that it might fall down (so internally feeling to have atleast this profit)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> This point is not valid for value investors or for that matter investors who look at the long run. Overall, this book is more suitable for traders.</p>

<p>We make irrational decisions and we all know that. But only some of us know that those decisions are predictable, repeatable and can be changed (not easily though). This book by Dan Ariely explores on some of those irrational decisions we make and how we can do better by simply listening to ourselves before deciding. Do read this book to understand how human behavior works and how we can be the real owners of our decisions where author demonstrates with a series of experiments</p>

<p>Eleanor Oliphant is a 30-sh woman in Glasgow, whose life is pretty simple (and maybe considered as boring at the start but not actually) i.e cycle of work and sleep with a rigid, planned timetable. But she has a scarred past and the rest of the story uncovers what it is and how she feels about it, opens herself up. </p>

<h4>Author: Oliver Sacks</h4>
<h4>Read on: Oct 2020</h4>
<p>This book deals with the extreme bizarre neurological cases observed by Dr. Oliver Sacks in the 19th century. He claims that every case needs to be treated separately because some patients would like to have a disease (yes, it may sound strange but read it) rather than getting cured while some patients feel bad after it's cured etc; It's a bit technical and somewhat difficult to follow for a normal reader so choose accordingly after reading the review.</p>
<p><b>Have you ever felt that a disease is something that just destroys the person i.e the affected will be unhappy for the rest of their life?</b></p>
<p>If you think it's a YES, definitely read this book to know why you might not be correct. If you say it's a NO (means you already know few people with some peculiar diseases who lead happy life), then maybe this adds new perspective and lots of extra information. (I am not supporting that it's good to have a disease but their cases teach a lot about life) </p>

The author used psychological tactics and made each chapter constrained to 1-2 pages so that reader is intact and he changed the narration in multiple timelines (Something similar to Nolan's technique in movies). The author made a gripping and heart touching fiction connecting radio, some magical stone, an orphan and a blind girl.</p>

<h4>Author: Phil Knight</h4>
<h4>Read on: May 2020</h4>
<p>Whenever you look at the stories of successful companies, it is exciting to see how the founders are highly passionate towards their dreams. While most of us are aware of the anecdotes like <i>“college-dropout-making-computers” (Microsoft)</i> or <i>“connectivity-from-dorms” (Facebook)</i>, we might not have heard the stories of other companies. Phil Knight, made an attempt to share his journey in creating Nike with his memoir, “Shoe dog”. It’s heart touching, a fascinating journey and has philosophical aspects. His life (or maybe his narration) is somewhat cinematic where the protagonist explores the world, takes risks, has ups and downs and finally builds this huge empire that we see today.</p>

<h4>Author: Anne Frank</h4>
<h4>Read on: May 2020</h4>
<p>May 2020: Currently, we are in lockdown and are in home for past 50 days or so. If anyone of you feels that <b>&ldquo;What's this torture to me?&rdquo;</b>, then you should definitely read this book. We have social media, TV, internet and a lot of other distractions yet, we feel so lonely during lockdown and feels it as a &ldquo;prison&rdquo; and want to go out.</p>
<p>Favourite lines from book:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Paper has more patience than people</p>
</li>
<li><p>You only really get to know a person after a fight. Only then you can judge their true character</p>
</li>
<li><p>The apple never falls far from the tree</p>
</li>
<li><p>Riches, prestige, everything can be lost. But the happiness in your heart can only be dimmed: it will always be there, as long as you live, to make you happy again</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deep down, the young are lonelier than the old</p>

<h4>Authors: Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths</h4>
<h4>Read on: Nov 2019</h4>
<p>I came to Bangalore (India) in Aug 2019 and within a few days, the first problem I faced was <i>“To search a room”</i>. The company gave a week to search and settle down. Luckily, I found a good place to stay near the office within 2 days. But a small question came to my mind, <b>“For how long should I need to search to secure a room, given the competition for PGs or flats?”</b> — Is there any safe way to search and secure a good room?
Within a couple of months, I found the answer (or a mathematical explanation) for this question. (though it was accidentally by reading this book!)</p>
<p>Have you ever felt like <b>“What’s the use of this?”</b> or <b>“Where can I apply this practically?”</b> (when studying a particular theory). This book offers excellent applications of how computer science algorithms (or mathematics) can be applied to our daily world problems and improve our decision-making skills.</p>
